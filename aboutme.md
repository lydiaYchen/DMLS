I returned to academia, after a decade of industry experience at the IBM Research Zurich Lab.  I am currently a professor at University of Neuchatel and TU Delft. I am the director of Distributed Learning Systems Lab. My research interests lie in the distinct areas of deep machine learning, big data systems,  performance modeling and privacy enhancing technology. My research is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Dutch National Science Foundation the European Union, IBM Research,  ABB, and TU Delft. 

Over the years, I have worked on  performance modeling and resource management problems of various computing systems, such as web services, cloud data centers, and big data processing systems. My recent focus on distributed machine learning algorithms and  systems  leads me to address exciting areas.
 
- Privacy-preserving learning systems by synthetic data: 
how to maximize the knowledge of  while maintaining data privacy ? I am exploring the deep generative models to synthesize data. 

- Robust learning systems:
how to make learning algorithms robust against adversaries that maliciously manipulate data input? I am designing practical strategies and theories against attackers, e.g., free riders, and thief.
 
- Federated machine learning systems:
how to decentralizedly learn deep learning models on heterogeneous clients who contentiously encounter new learning tasks and data domain shift? I am working on domain adaptation, and continual learning in FL.

# Short Bio

Lydia Y. Chen is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Prior to joining TU Delft, she was a research staff member at the IBM Research Zurich Lab from 2007 to 2018. She holds a PhD from Pennsylvania State University and a BA from National Taiwan University. Her research interests are distributed machine learning,  dependability management,  large-scale data processing systems and services. More specifically, her work focuses on developing machine learning and stochastic models, and applying these techniques to application domains, such as data centers and AI systems. 

She has published more than 100 papers in peer-reviewed journals, including IEEE Transactions on Distributed Systems and IEEE Transactions on Service Computing, and in conference proceedings, including INFOCOM, SIGMETRICS, DSN, and EUROSYS. She was a co-recipient of the best paper awards at CCGrid’15 and eEnergy’15. She received TU Delft technology fellowship in 2018.  She was program co-chair for IEEE IC2E 21, IEEE ICAC 2019, Middleware Industry track 2018, track vice-chair for ICDCS 2018, and DIAS 2017. She serves on the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on Service Computing and IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management. She is an IEEE senior member.
